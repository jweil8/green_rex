### Description:
  I'd like to create a strain recommender that takes in an some user inputs on: how they want to feel, taste, their experiecne with the product etc. It will then return a dictionary wiht 3 or so strains along with a description of the strains and related strains. Want to include information on the terpene profiles, and what questions to ask their budtender if they cannot find said strain in the store. I would like to have it also include store locations so that customers can get to the right spot, orrrrr if recomendaiton isnt in the store close to them, things at the store that are very similar.
