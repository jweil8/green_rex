"So I have a history of panic attacks when smoking weed so I stopped for a long time (5 years). Now Im getting back on it and I've notice if I smoke in small amounts I dont get Anxiety like I used to. But When I smoked this strain.... I got too HIGH! haha I did get some Anxiety and kinda paranoid. Next time I'll smoke a little less.  "
