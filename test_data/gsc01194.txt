"I am a lightweight when it comes to smoking so the higher I can get with the least amount of weed, the better. And this strain definitely delivers. 
I am also a person that gets reverse effects (for me an Indica feels like a Sativa would for most people, and vice versa). So with this strain being a hybrid, I get the best of both worlds!"
