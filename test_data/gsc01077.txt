"amazing high, one of my favorites. i felt light as a feather. i was walking home with a friend and everything felt like i was walking in air, i was very giggly but not in an annoying way, we were very high and it was a 30 minute walk and we couldnâ€™t walk normally for sh*t. we just looked like we were skipping around but it was absolutely amazing "
