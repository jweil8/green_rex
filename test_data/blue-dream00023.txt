"Love, love, love this strain! Taste is a nice balance of berry and pine, fast and hard hitting, great for migraine relief and a pleasant high recreationally. Hits me almost more like an Indica, and gives me an almost psychedelic high with amazing closed eye visuals. No other strain does that to me. 

Also a great horny strain. My god. "
