"GSC IS a great strain for me personally.  It really hits you by the second hit. Im smoking a small but very new bowl pack, complimentary of ROLLW/US (THANK YOU for the gifts. I was given a nice purple crusher as well!) with purchase of first order. I thought that was cool. The taste has floral notes, but doesn't linger long on your tastebuds. I would definitely recommend this strain to anyone. "
