"Green Crack is one of those unusually strong Sativa's that can work as a daytime choice for pain. Great for pain, yet still stomach settling. I use it in a mix with Green Crack to kick the ass of my : cancer pain, peripheral neuropathy, bone pain, back pain, myofascial pain, central nerve sensitization and Fibromyalgia pain."
