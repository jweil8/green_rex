"I think that the experience with this strain was absolutely awesome. Me and @Jsnsns had a new favorite strain. We were so creative that we waxed each otherâ€™s legs and made an amazing ash tray out of metal conserves. We can highly recommend that strain. Maybe you wonâ€™t be as creative as we were but youâ€™ll come close to it belief me ðŸ¤«ðŸ˜‰"
