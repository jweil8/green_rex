"Five rips from the bong and I'm GONE!! This flower is real stinky, but the  colors are awesome, mostly purple with strands of brown and green, super enticing! The high is strong and cerebral, but clear, plenty of energy and creativity. Awesome anytime flower. Very potent strain I love every time! "
