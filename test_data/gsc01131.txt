"Girl Scout Cookies is a great strain. I stepped on a push pin while on GSC and had no idea it was in my foot until my wife pointed it out. Exceptional pain relief and incredibly relaxing. Definitely a good hybrid starter stain. There is a reason I call it "the smoke-a-cola of the cannabis world." It's a classic!"
