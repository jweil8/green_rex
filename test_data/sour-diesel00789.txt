"Kind of the go to sativa. I think it might be top shelf but it has every typical trait of a sativa. I’m a heavy smoker and this tends to keep me awake and high for a decent amount of time based on one dab. I like the chemical kind of taste and smell to it as well. If you’ve smoked this a bunch I say try some other stuff but if you’re new to smoking try this as a baseline for how sativas are. "
