"I love green crack and typically purchase it when available to me. I’m reviewing buds bought from INSA in Easthampton, MA. A beautiful light green, crystally color. Fruity, sweet smell and taste. Quick hitting hard sativa high. Leaves me uplifted, with a focused, clear high. Energizing but doesn’t keep me up. A great bud for being active. "
