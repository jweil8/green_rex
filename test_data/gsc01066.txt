"GSC is one of my top 3 strains (medical). 
** Use: severe, chronic, spine & joint pain / muscle spasms. Works quickly. It's best for day, but doesn't keep me awake if I use it later.

** Effects: Relaxing. Nice, clear head high. A good, cheerful mood, without being too talkative, giggly or spacey. Able to focus, talk, or read. Easy on throat & no coughing when vaping flower."
