"Sour diesel is by far the best chronic I've tried. The effects are phenomenal and I was blasted after a raw joint 
I was able to finish all my work without a coffee it's like this strain can replace my coffee all together with the strong mental focus and a desire to complete your task 
All I can say is if you haven't tried this strain then you haven't tried true chronic
