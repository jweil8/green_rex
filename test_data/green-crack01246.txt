"review for Green crack hydrocarbon crumble. tested at 70% THC no CBD test results. very nice heavy head buzz. very euphoric. great for a morning pick me up if you can handle it. great taste, fruity with a hint of pine and skunk. consistency of the wax was awesome. color was spectacular. obtained from Urban Wellness in Albuquerque NM for $25 a half gram. well worth it. great job Urban Wellness and elevated concentrate..."
