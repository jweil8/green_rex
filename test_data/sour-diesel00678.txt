"i tend to prefer a more relaxed high, but sour diesel was a nice change of pace.

the incline and climax felt overwhelmingly positive, and inspired, and productive. on the way down, itâ€™s peaceful, and giggly. smooth on the comedown with no crash. in the morning, it pairs well with coffee. at night, it makes a light yoga practice feel really enjoyable and leads to deep satisfying sleep. no complaints."
