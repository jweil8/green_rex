"Sour D was my first experience with a bong and after the first hit, I was gone. It was like a double shot of espresso, me and my buddy couldn't stay in the car and went for a walk in 5 degree weather because we needed something to do. If you want to get shit done, this is for you. And yes we hit a bong in a car, shit was cash."
