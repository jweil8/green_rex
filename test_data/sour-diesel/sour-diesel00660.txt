"I enjoy sativas and have grown this strain many times. For me, Sour Diesel has a pronounced stoning effect and short duration, thus 3 stars. I prefer the clarity and long effects of Durban and Jack Herer phenotypes. I guess I got used to that type of sativa  before the Sour D came along in the 90's."
