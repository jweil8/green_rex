"Lately I’ve been having a huge tolerance to weed, I couldn’t even get remotely high unless I had at least 3 or 4 bowls. But when I got Sour D and smoked it, the first hit I could feel a small high, now it only takes me two bowls until I stop. It lasts a long time, and while coming off the high I don’t feel tired and sluggish but instead I feel energized and happy with life. Definitely recommend Sour D. "
