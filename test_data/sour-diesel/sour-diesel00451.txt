"Sour diesel is by far, one of my favorite strains. It has an uplifting and positive outlook effect that can cure some slight depression or a bad day instantly. I like to smoke it and do projects in the yard or around the house. There is almost no fatigue or drowsiness effects for me. It is a superb strain for active individuals and you can still remainly focused on what you are doing. I give it an A+."
