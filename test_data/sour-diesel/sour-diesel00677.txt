"This is my second review for Sour Diesel. It's been way too long since I've had the pleasure of smoking this great flower. It's like meeting back up with an old good friend, no matter how long it's been, you just seem to pick back up where you left off last. The head high is expansive and just a little trance like. Perfect for the day time. You just can't go wrong with this one. It's a classic for good reason."
