"Sour d is always a dank strain. I've smoked it quite a bit of flower but this is just the 2nd time I've had it in shatter. It's always good tho & I love its texture. Real easy to stretch it out & take a dab. I'm in an illegal state but has anyone else tried the sour d shatter? What y'all think if so?"
