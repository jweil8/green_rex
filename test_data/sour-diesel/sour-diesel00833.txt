"This strain is one thatâ€™ll keep you going and energized, great for a wake and bake but although it keeps you up and energized itâ€™s not really good for pain relief and leaves much to be desired there other than that it has a phenomenal flavor profile with very strong lemon tastes except itâ€™s sweet and that classic diesel taste."
