"This strain hit me like a psychedelic. I bought an eighth and the second I took a whiff from the buds I was extremely excited to smoke it. I noticed I got super spaced out and my thoughts were very trippy.  Then it felt like I could feel my God damned nuerons firing in my brain, this sensation was extremely pleasurable. This is the trippiest strain for me and I just love it."
