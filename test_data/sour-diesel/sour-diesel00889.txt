"This strain makes me tired, hungry and foggy headed feeling. I know a lot of people like Sour D for it's uplifting properties, but it does the opposite for me. It's also the only strain that makes me feel really depressed and lethargic. 

My Dr suggested Sour D for my ADHD (I've been on Adderall for over 10 years). It did not help my ADHD symptoms."
