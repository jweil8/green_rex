"Amazing strain. I was lucky enough to received my buds in perfect condition and my god that sh*t hit harddddd. It's a Sativa, so of course you're going to be active and happy and all that good stuffs, i felt it, an amazing starin for day time. Gives a gassy, pungent smell of diesel and a bit of lemon x citrus for that sourness, too. Highly recommended. A must-try strain for all stoners out there. Cheers!"
