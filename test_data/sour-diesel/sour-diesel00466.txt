"A short high. I'm a fairly new smoker so it lasted me a good two hours. It isn't super fast hitting but give it a good 15-30 minutes and you are waavyyyy. Instantly makes you happy for no apparent reason, & makes you laugh at stupid shit. The smell is suuper loud and SUUUUUUUPER loud when grinded. It smells and tastes like lime and wood with diesel. Very fun to smoke I would say."
