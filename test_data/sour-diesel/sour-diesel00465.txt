"This strain was one of my first ever. It delivers a strong hit of skunky smelly flavors. It has a frequent tendency of producing dry mouth and on some occasions slight paranoia. This strain is great for beginners and is great for pain relieve, depression, not so much for anxiety or stress. Over and above all sour diesel is more or less a breeding tool for making great hybrids."
