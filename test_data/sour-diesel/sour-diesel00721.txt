"Powerful, long-lasting creeper. Took a while to kick in, but when it did it gave a strong mind & body buzz that made everything better. Still tingling when I woke up the next morning! As long as the creeper doesn't trick you into overdoing it, SD could be the perfect strain for daytime functioning & evening socializing."
