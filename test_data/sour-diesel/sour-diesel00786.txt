"Sour Diesel is one of the most classic American strains typically common in New York (as a medical patient) of course it gives the user a feeling of joy and at ease. It's great for users who suffer from depression or just need a little mood boost for there day. Nevertheless, sour diesel is definitely more than just a morning cup of joe for less experienced users or those who are taking larger dosages. Cheers- Ligma"
