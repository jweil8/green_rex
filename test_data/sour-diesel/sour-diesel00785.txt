"I took this strain to the NYE SLEEP concert at Great American Music Hall, and I can say that this strain was a great pick for the show. 

I was feeling most of the high around my head and eyes and was moving with the music. A good strain no doubt, however I think this strain is more suitable for productivity. That is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. "
