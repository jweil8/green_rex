"Yeah, this strain is powerful stuff. It lifts my mood but it also makes me dumb. Like walk in the kitchen then forget why I'm in there dumb. Or like I just had a text exchange and wasn't making sense dumb. This is fine when I'm home alone trying to disconnect from a long day, but I would not smoke this before a social outing or chilling with my significant other. They definitely won't get the best version of me. Lol"
