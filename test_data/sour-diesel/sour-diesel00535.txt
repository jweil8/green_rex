"Relatively short-lived high, but longer-lasting pain relief.  Can be a little racy if you wake-n-bake and have a big cup of coffee, but not really anxiety-provoking on its own.  Good for situations where you need pain relief and also need to be focused and cognizant.  One of the few sativas I've found that's good on muscle spasm.  Also good on centrally mediated fatigue as in CFS, MS, fibro."
