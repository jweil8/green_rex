"My all time fav!! When I take a couple big hits I'm relaxed head high. Giggly and uplifting. Smoke more (like blunt to myself) I'm in a euphoric state couch lock. I smoked a blunt between four people in the early afternoon walked home ate just about everything in the house passed out early woke up in the morning STILL HIGH!! It was amazing. Definitely my #1."
