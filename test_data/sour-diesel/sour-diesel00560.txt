"Great goodness, just one G and I was feeling amazing. This strain has a really interesting chemical like smell, and the taste is no different. The effects leave you very happy, I was having a rough day the first time I smoked this and all of my stress was lifted away. Great strain for conversations and TV! Overall a good balance of euphoria, relaxation, and energy."
