"One of my favorite strains due to its extremely enjoyable high. This one always makes me giggly, even with my high tolerance. Great for listening to music, jamming, and pretty much anything that that involves being awake! The smell is a potent lemon/lime/pine smell. Buds are medium sized, medium density, and covered in long red hairs and resin glands.
