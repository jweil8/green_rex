"Girl Scout Cookies has a pure and invigorating aroma reminiscent of candy and sweets in general. GSC remains my all time favorite because it puts me in a creative state of mind where nothing else matters but what Iâ€™m doing. I become one with nature when taking photographs, and as light as ever regarding my mood."
