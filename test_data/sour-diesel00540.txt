"I'm not a fan of sativas because it can trigger my anxiety. But sour diesel treats me right. I woke up about an hour ago and made some coffee, then took my first hit of this strain. I'm so happy and uplifted right now, and I'm not lethargic. I'm ready to take on the day and I'm full of energy! I don't feel anxious but I also didn't smoke too much. Two hits is all I need to start my day. I love this!!"
