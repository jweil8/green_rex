"I first thought this strain was a bit weak or at least the batch I had. but then it creeps on you so hard! one of my favorite strains. I don't get the super munchies with it, but food some how tastes amazing no matter what. amazing anxiety reducer and it's a calm head high for me. you can get things done while smoking this strain, but also relax with it.
