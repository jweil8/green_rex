"Clearly a good strain to try! 
Got that delicious flower from Sqdc in Quebec and I am surprised by its effects. Took less than 3 minutes to start to feel it once vaporized, and the high keeps you just far enough so you can have a great experience, but not far enough to make you a Slug. 
Anyway.
The weed was too dry when I buyed it, but the effects are there, and the aroma too.
It is a must try."
