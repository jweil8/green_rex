"A classic famous strain. Potency and even effects can vary depending on who grew it but it generally has the well-known dreamy effects. A nice hybrid for mentally "checking out" for a while and having a good time. Good for anxiety and depression, decent but inconsistent for pain. Definitely worth checking out."
