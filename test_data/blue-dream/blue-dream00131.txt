"Probably the best hybrid I've tried. Balance of head high, body high. Has multiple levels, like steps! Helped with shoulder pain, made me laugh and was able to do a ton of stuff around the house. I'd absolutely recommend it!! Tasty, great smell and high. I dry vape it and you really get a great flavor. It's an any time of day strain! "
