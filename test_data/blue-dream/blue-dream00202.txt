"Tried this for the first time today. Took two small hits from my vape and waited for about 20 minutes. Just when I thought I hadn't vaped enough, it kicked in. 

The high is very relaxing but you still get a good head buzz as well. Great for just chilling on the couch or you can also be productive on it if you want. 

Took almost all my pain away once it kicked in. Very happy with Blue Dream!"
