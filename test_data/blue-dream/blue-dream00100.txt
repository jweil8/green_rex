"This was the first strain I actually experienced "being high" on. I don't know if I was just smoking shit weed or not enough before, but I took a few hits of this and I actually thought I was in a dream. Everything seemed surreal and convoluted. I almost called my mom because I was so sure I wasn't actually in reality. Looking back, that whole night just seems hilarious. 5/7 perfect score for this strain. "
