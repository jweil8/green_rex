"I got this strain from GTI in Chicago and it's very nice. Nothing too crazy about it. It keeps you clear headed while relaxing your body and promoting a good mood. It helped a little bit with headaches and inflammation. I don't have anything bad to say about this strain but it also didn't WOW me. I used it to christen my new Pax 3."
