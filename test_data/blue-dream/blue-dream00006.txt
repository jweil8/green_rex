"Incredible strain, especially for wanting to get activities and responsibilities done. It provides a very energetic & alert high that will give you an adventurous demeanor. Two dabs of blue dream cake badder had me cleaning my kitchen and room while listening to some of the finest cannabis friendly music. A great smoke for the person who wants to get out or just get up to get some shit done!"
