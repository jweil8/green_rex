"i’m currently a cancer patient and i just had a cycle of chemotherapy yesterday and have been experiencing nausea and vomiting all day.  i smoked some blue dream specifically for relief and it has worked like a charm.  for the first time today my spirits are high, i don’t feel any nausea and am able to keep some things down.  this stuff truly is medicine."
