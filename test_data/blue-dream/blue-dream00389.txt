"Honestly, this strain is great for every & any cannabis user. I think it's actually ideal for 1st time smokers as well. Gives a nice body & head effect without being too intense. Has a sweet, enjoyable flavor & the smell is very welcoming. It's a mellow mix of Indica & Sativa. A neutral hybrid. Level playing-field."
