"Kicked my migraine on this!!!  After 2 Maxalt I was still in enough pain to go to the ER.  The last thing I felt like doing was vaping, now I know to vape as soon as the migraine hits.  This is a nice mellow high with less cerebral more body.  It is ok for beginners and would be great for headaches, anxiety, pain and depression."
