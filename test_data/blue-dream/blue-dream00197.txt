"Nice creative, deep thinking, high concentration, alert feeling.  Makes me sleepy but not too sleepy.  No issues falling asleep or staying awake.  There are perhaps more relaxing, less hyper-active and paranoid feeling strains than this one, but Blue Dream is nice for what I mentioned in the beginning of my review."
