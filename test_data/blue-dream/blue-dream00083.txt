"I smoke this for social anxiety and it does wonders. I feel physically relaxed after a few hits, and my mind is brought to a happier place where I don’t care as much about the little things that could go wrong in life. However, if you do smoke too much you will be couch bound. If that does happen, just grab some water, a few snacks and binge watch Big Mouth on Netflix, it’ll be a great experience."
