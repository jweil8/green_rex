"One of the top dogs in the Sativa realm.  Looks plump and healthy with bright orange hairs coursing within each nug. Invigorating fruit smell with a blend of that "danky" resonance. The high gives off an inspiring cerebral buzz and penetrative focus. I feel spritually, mentally and physically shard/aligned. This strain is well respected and reflected. I've had it many times. One of my faves!"
