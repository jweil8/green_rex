"Fell in love with this in oil form a while back. Recently vaporized flower for the first time. An equally amazing experience. Tastes like citra hops. I haven't had the energy to exercise at all for months. Today I ran 2 miles and managed to get a full body workout in, post green crack. A far cry from the 15 mile/three hour torturous workouts I was doing two years ago but godd*mn if it doesn't give me hope "
