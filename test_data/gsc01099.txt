"Love GSC! This strain offers a great high that supports an energetic and talkative mindset. It's a great daytime smoke that creates a functional high. I feel clear and level headed when I use this strain. This does the trick when I have things to do or when I'm in an a group environment. I use the Trulieve vape pen and concrete and it's fantastic."
