"Definitely one of my top 10 favs, I fucking love this strain. For daily users and not recommended for beginners. But if you dare to try as a beginner you're in for a very euphoric and perfectly balanced high. You have a tingly sensation through your spine while you are feeling both the body and mind high. You can smoke this for any event, everywhere and anytime. It flows with you and I fucking love it."
