"This stuff is very fast-acting, and very potent.  Very heady high, and long-lasting.  Took a puff of this, took a four hour nap, woke up still feeling absolutely blunted.  Very good for fighting nausea and lack of appetite, cuz you get the munchies pretty hardcore.  Completely destroyed my anxiety mid-attack and had me giggling for a good ten minutes about thirty minutes later.  Very, very good stuff."
