"I was in a lot of pain at the end of the work day. All of my joints had stiffened up, but my knees, hips and back were especially bothering me. Arthritis is a bitch! As soon as I got home, I loaded a pre-filled cartridge of Girl Scout Cookies into my vape pen. After only 4 or 5 puffs, I was pain free and feeling mighty good! Very fast-acting! Love this strain! This one is on permanent stand-by."
