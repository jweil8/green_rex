"Your classic sativa hybrid.  Bright green nugs were about 80% concealed in yellow and orange hairs, very visually appealing greenhouse grown! Euphoric, happy, dreamy with just a hint of energy - good for creative activities.  Some audio-hallucinations, good for listening to music and cruising.  Some body numbness,  but maybe not choice for pain.  Anti-depressive, anti-anxiety."
