"Super common strain over here on the east coast, a lot of this strain even gets sold under different names but are textbook examples of blue dream. And its popular for good reason. 
The balance between cerebral and body are awesome. Relaxing but not a knock-out punch. Uplifted without anxiety or paranoia. Awesome for mid-day or evening use but not bad for morning either in smaller amounts. 
Smells of sweet blueberrie..."
