"This stuff is soothing and uplifting at the same time! Excellent for depression, really, really improves your mood. Also, it's not a couch-potato maker. Go lightly, and you'll be fine with most daily tasks. It's relaxing. Good for nausea and lack of appetite too. It's a pleasant smoke, not stinky or cough-inducing. I plan to keep some around!"
