"I smoked this before a concert and it was the first time I was very out of it while high. Maybe just simply that I smoked too much, but I wasn't able to cross streets, have normal conversations or understand reality. This strain would probably work well at home with close friends or by yourself, but in public...it's a lot. Taste is great, smell is great, just very trippy."
