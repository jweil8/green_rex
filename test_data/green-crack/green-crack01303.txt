"One of my faves. Green Crack leaves me in good spirits-not giggly but definitely easy to make laugh-with decent full body (functional) fuzz that is perfect for fighting off the blues or any stress, or even just to calm some social anxiety. The taste is strong and a bit skunky, but well worth trying if you're looking for a happy Sativa."
