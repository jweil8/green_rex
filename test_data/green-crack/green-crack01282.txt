"This is NOT a pure Sativa. its very much like an indica dominant hybrid. at first its energetic and focusing. it relieves pain very well and has its uplifting notes but the amount of myrcene can lock you on that couch !! 

I give it a 10/10 for PMS and menstrual cramps. Ladies this os the strain to get you through a work day during your time of the month. but not my type of everyday strain"
