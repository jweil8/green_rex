"My favorite Sativa (and cannabis in general)! This is my go-to strain! If you live in WA state, I recommend the “Rochester Farms” product over the “Legends” grower. Uplifting, euphoric, super cerebral “head high” but leaves you with lots of energy! Never had much anxiety nor panic attacks (THC can sometimes cause anxiety with me) with this strain. Haven’t found a better sativa yet!"
