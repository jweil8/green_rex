"I just had shoulder surgery, just three months prier I had back surgery. From just about every little thing that is expected after surgery is now brought down to a very minimum, The pain after surgery,with swelling, soreness, depression, mental effects, and anxiety all were somewhat extinguished. Very comfortable. Saved my life from long term pain relief"
