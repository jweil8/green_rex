"This strain is really strong and it will hit you within seconds. God, Girl Scout cookies relaxes me like no other. I have bad anxiety and it really helps. With Girl Scout I also have very deep thoughts and I get creative. The only negative I can think of is that I find it hard to remember things when I smoke this. Lol amazing strain, would buy again "
