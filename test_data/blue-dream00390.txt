"Purchased at the SQDC in Quebec. Blue Dream by Aurora. 19% THC. When I bought it i thought it would be too strong for me as I am sensitive to THC. I loaded my Utilian with 0.15g of Blue dream and man..it was great. Felt a mild head high that came in almost immediatly. Felt calm and happy, slightly uplifted but not energetic like a pure sativa does to me. Then after about 30 minutes I felt even more relaxed throughout..."
