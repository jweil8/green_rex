"Picked some of this up from CuraLeaf in South Florida (vape cart) and it's my go to strain after work to unwind without falling asleep. Very mellow and calm, but I wouldn't recommend if you have a bunch of shit to do (I found myself dragging though the days errands after a few good hits on my vape). I would definitely get some of this again "
