"When you’ve had a shitty week, your boss is being a dick, and you just need a chance to breathe and feel good again, look no further than Blue dream. It took me from a ball of tightly wound stress and nerves, to the happiest man alive. I had a smile on my face for 2 hours. The best high I think I’ve had to date. 100% the new favourite of mine."
