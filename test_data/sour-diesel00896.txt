"I used to love this strain. It made me super active and was very uplifting. But more recently is has made me very anxious. I think this could be because of how it interacts with the SSNRI Iâ€™m on - Effexor (225mg). Just a warning to anyone else on this or similar antidepressants, or maybe anyone else prone to anxiety or panic attacks. "
