"My absolute favorite strain as of 2016. I love this strain because I can take a hit or 2 before the start of my day and at the end of the day I can take some bong rips and sleep like a baby. It helps with my burden of anxiety on a daily basis. A must for us riddled with mental illness, loss of appetite or insomnia. Highly recommended my loves. "
