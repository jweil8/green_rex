"GSC was the very first strain I smoked, a whole year ago. I am still smoking on this stuff. The high is just amazing. You have a clear head high, you can still get tasks done, spaciness is still there but not in the way you would expect. GSC is a strain everyone should try, it is usually very common and easy to find too. Most dispensaries sell GSC. Cheers"
