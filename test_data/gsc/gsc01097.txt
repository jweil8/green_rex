"Lovely, lovely strain! It's very uplifting and even makes me a bit on the thoughtful side. Definitely has relaxation effects but I'm not sluggish. I'm very calm and happy. The flower taste is very sweet with an earthy hint. And the smoke... oh, it leaves such a pleasant smell after, nothing too skunky. This is a must have for when I want to let my imagination run!"
