"One of my favorite strains. Iâ€™m reviewing GSC in bud form from NETA in Northampton, MA. Bought on 1/5/19, enjoyed out of a spoon bowl. Appearance of this bud is out of this world. It has perfect density. It tastes great on inhale and exhale. Quick hitting, focused and relaxed. I feel both sativa and indica effects; tied flies after consumption and was able to focus and be creative yet very calm/relaxed. "
