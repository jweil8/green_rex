"One of my all time favorites and a go-to strain for lowered anxiety and an overall sense of relaxation and creative awareness.  Excellent auditory sensations ... music is utterly delightful.  Also excellent for increasing libido and general sensuality.  Beautiful, sweet scent (almost like cotton candy at the first clean smoke) and great vibrant green color."
