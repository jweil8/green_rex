"Holy shit, this stuff is the real deal.

I struggle with depression and anxiety and typically try to stay away from sativas and unresearched hybrids, but after a recommendation, I tried GSC.

Well it works like a fucking charm. I felt amazing, happy, confident, and excited for the first time in a while. Of course I only vape this at night, but for me it's a very functional high, but also very relaxing."
