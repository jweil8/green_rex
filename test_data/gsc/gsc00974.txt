"4.8/5
Ohhh man, what can I say about the classics? Got this in another nug run, extracted out to 90.8 percent! Dark and piney with a smell just like the plants themselves, Consistency reminds me of a hair thicker than clear (sometimes a good freeze makes a hell of a difference). A-MAZING for a daily driver. Pain relief without the dab crash. This is the best way to get every positive effect THC can provide."
