"yo assuming this strain was a person and I was in a prison shower with this strain I'd have it's back.

I used to suffer from schizophrenia and such bad anxiety that I would shake in any social situated. I smoked this strain and it all went away.

it kept me care free, motivated, focused, pain free, anger literally rewired my mind in such a positive way that nothing compares to this.

gsc smoker for life!"
