"I grow this every year and I love it! I like that when it flowers the smell isnâ€™t overwhelming. I also can plant in July and easily get 1lb per plant. The taste is AMAZING and I can not get enough. I also grow other strains but, I can smoke just this all year long and be totally cool with that. "
