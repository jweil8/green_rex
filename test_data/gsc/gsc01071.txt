"I smoked some with a bunch of friends, we were all passing around a blunt and let me tell you how great this strain is. My high was so relaxing, relieving, and just plain amazing. Girl Scout Cookies I also recommend for beginners ;)
You'll love it, and if you have anxiety attacks/panic attacks/ anxiety disorder; this weed is for you my friend :)"
