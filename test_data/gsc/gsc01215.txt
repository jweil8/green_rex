"everyone seems to love this strain so much but i personally hate it. it’s not for me. i bought this a bit ago and was upset because i thought my tolerance was just too high because i smoke everyday and wasn’t getting high a bit not matter how many bowls i smoked. bought a different strain, and got high. purchased this again and now i’m realizing it’s this strain. i don’t like."
