"Wonderful strain but approach with caution!

Great for keeping you focused and motivated throughout the day but may not be the best if you are in social situations if you are prone to anxiety and paranoia. Want to clean the house, index your entire music library or pave your driveway? This is the strain you need!

Oh, it will help curb the appetite as well. "
