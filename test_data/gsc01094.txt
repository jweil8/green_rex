"I tried GSC for the first time today and absolutely love it.  Took only one deep hit and that was enough for my pain to ease up for quite awhile.  Very impressed with its effectiveness.  On a side note, it also helped with the floaters in my eyes.  They are gone, I'm sure temporarily, but at least I'm not seeing them shoot across my eyes for now."
