"Now, if you’re a newbie, don’t take more than 2 hits! I did four and had to ride out a wild trip that made me just want to feel normal. But, if you do things right and only take only two hits... you’ll be a happy camper. Won’t be stoned, but you will feel good and energetic. I honestly prefer this over preworkout mix. "
