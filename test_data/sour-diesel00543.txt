"This is my go to strain. It never ever everrrrr let's me down. This strain is perfect for just about doing anything from working on a project to watching a good movie. When you're not sure what to pick give Sour D a try. I love the head rush and body vibrations this strain gives me. It doesn't make me feel slow or Stoney. I feel motivated but relaxed and peaceful at the same time. Sour brings out the best in me."
