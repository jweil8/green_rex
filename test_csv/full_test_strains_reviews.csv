With this strain I am also able to go to the gym, I stay motivated and focused. I notice I am engaging. Definitely a conversation starter. 

The taste is not bad and her smell is beautiful. She is a beautiful bud. 10/10

Brand: Royal High.

Okay smell and taste, but not nearly as rich as some people have experienced. You can faintly taste chocolate on the exhale sometimes. 

Tastewise it is great as a pairing with a sherried scotch though.

Some couch lock at first, then the urge to be productive. Turn off the lights and you get an extremely introspective high, which could send beginner tokers into a very bad trip.
